## Motivation
### Giving Recreational Athletes the Professional Experience
Our project takes inspiration from the concept of an “open run”. It’s a basketball term which is used to describe pickup basketball games where anyone is able to create teams in order to play against other teams. That is, we’re building an app that’ll allow people to connect to each other in order to play against one another. Imagine it’s summer and you’re hoping to run a game of 5v5 at your local park; however, you don’t have a team and don’t know whether anyone is actually even at the local park. You’d be able to open this app, look for your local park on the map, and instantly be able to see whether any teams in that area are looking for an additional member. You’d be able to save the time and headache of having to assemble a team and going to the park in real life to determine whether any games are actually being played. This is just the basic premise of the app. Naturally a user would be able to look at any park on the map and see any listing for a team member or be able to post their own listing for a team. This way you’d also be able to determine how busy a park that you were planning on playing at is and whether or not you should go elsewhere. Additional features would include the level of player that you’re hoping to play with, some people don’t feel confident playing against individuals who are much more skilled than they are and as such can save themselves from that embarrassment, profile progression page, possibly a chat feature, and expansion to include other sports such as soccer, cricket, lacrosse and etc. At the touch of a finger you’d be able to easily find a team to play sports of your choosing, currently only basketball, and possibly make new friends in the process.
