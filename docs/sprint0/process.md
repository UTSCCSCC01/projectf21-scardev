###**Team Organization**


The team worked well together. We were all familiar with each other beforehand and so chemistry was not an issue.We organized ourselves through our meetings on Discord. Together we were able to identify our goals and come up with suitable times for us to meet, at least once a week every week in the evenings, and identify each other’s strengths and weaknesses. We settled on having two teams of two focusing on frontend, backend, and one member left with full-stack development. However, everything will be a collaborative effort and help will be given by members when needed.

###**Decision Making**


Making decisions was fairly simple. Everyone was encouraged to give their ideas on topics and through discourse we were able to make final choices based on how the majority was feeling. 

###**User Stories Prioritization**


We defined priority of user stories on two sets of criterias. How easy we believe we can implement the user story and how essential it is to the minimum viable product. User stories that were essential to the minimum viable product were immediately placed at the top of the product backlog regardless of how easy they were. But, if a user story was deemed to be not as essential to the minimum viable product then those that were easier were towards the end of the product backlog as they wouldn’t take a lot of time to complete. On average it took about two rounds of voting to decide on the priority of a user story.

###**Meetings**


We met around 3-4x per week during the first sprint on Discord and were in communication daily through text messaging.

###**Next Phase**


Moving on to the next phase we should keep in mind to get started on our tasks early, in order to give us more time to troubleshoot and aid one another and also to convene more often than we did this sprint to stay connected and on the same page.
