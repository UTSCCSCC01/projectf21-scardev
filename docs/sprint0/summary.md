## Project Objectives
Build the minimum viable product for OpenRun, a service which gives recreational athletes a professional experience at their local park. This web application will allow users to experience organized games at the park with team matchmaking, while using gamification to increase competitiveness.

## Key Users

### Players 
- Players who come to the park alone hoping to find a team using OpenRun

### Team Captains 
- Captains would love to schedule games in advance if they have a full team or can add a few players who don't have teams to their roster to complete their team

### Basketball Enthusiasts 
- People who would love to see highlights or pictures of people playing basketball at their local parks

## Scenarios

### Organize Games 
- Individual players and teams need a way to connect prior to the games, to avoid long wait times to play and have a more organized time playing at the park

### Create connections between players
- After matching players with teams, players can follow each other and message each other to set up games in the future

### Increase Competitiveness 
- Players would love to know which players are on win streaks at their local parks, who wouldn't love to put an end to the highest streak at your local park

## Principles

### Ease of use over efficiency 
- Athletes would like to create teams quickly without many questions or clutter even if that means compromising efficiency of application

### Connectivity is a Priority 
- We want athletes to feel connected to those who go to their local parks, there should be seamless communication to teams and other players
