## Other Market Competitiors
- Ballnow App
- CourtFinder
- Fullcourt
- Hoopmaps
- Playground buddy

### What they do
- These apps are quick and easy ways for people to find local parks and courts
- Some of these apps have limited extra functionality like volume of people

This is basically all that these apps do, and donâ€™t bring support for other meaningful features like matchmaking for other sports and keeping track. 
The reason for this is probably because they wanted to limit the scope of the app and have it simple and quick to find a court that has people.

## What our app brings to the table vs the competitors
- Our app is mainly aimed towards individuals or groups of people who get into games of basketball, soccer and other sports quickly and efficiently, i.e kids, teens, adults etc. 
- Individuals can mark themselves as free agents to join unfilled groups.
- Groups can fill vacancies in the group by recruiting free agents.
- The app removes any confusion of keeping track of scores during pickup games and can keep track of the score.
- In addition, players can specify their skill level. This is so that players can look for individuals and groups with equivalent skill levels to have good competitive games.
- Our app has a social aspect to it, as people can see leaderboards and record holders for a certain playground. People can get trophies and other accolades at their respective playground.
- In addition to keeping track of leaderboards and scores, you can directly message other people to say good games or invite them to play again at another time.

In conclusion, our playground app explores a market niche and will revolutionize playing at the park for all ages, with many different features and use cases for all park visitors. 
It serves to be a comprehensive app that overcomes the main drawback to some of the other apps like lack of features and only letting users know where parks are and how many people there are. 
Moreover, it's meant for all types of park sports players like soccer players, tennis players and more. It's not limited to just basketball. We hope to give park players a comprehensive app that will overall enhance their park visit.
