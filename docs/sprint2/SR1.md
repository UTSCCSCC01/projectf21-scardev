## Practices to Continue

- Our communication was great, everyone was always responsive!
    
-   We made sure to comment all of our code which made it helpful for each other to go and review each other’s work to provide aid

## New Practices to Use 

- Holding more stand ups as checkpoints for work to be done

## Harmful Practices to Stop
- Starting our work so late 

## Best/Worst Experience

- Our best experience during sprint one was a meeting we had during the second of the sprint. It was a productive meeting, not a standup, where we were able to re-align ourselves and got a lot done in terms of helping each other out with bugs and figuring out how we were going to get our login system to work. It felt like a team huddle.


- As for worst experience, there really wasn’t any, apart from the couple of hours we had before the sprint was due and just making sure everything was submitted, in terms of peer evaluation and the the main branch had the most recent commits.
