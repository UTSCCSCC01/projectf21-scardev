## Team Capacity
### Considering this is the second sprint, our team decided to dive deep and take on more user storeis. Many of us have become more accustom to the working styles and technologies, we now have a good idea of the flow of things. Considering this we have allocated around 10 hours per team member to tackle 8 user stories to complete a total of 65 priority points.
