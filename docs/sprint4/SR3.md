## Practices to Continue

- Communication continued to be great as always

## New Practices to Use 
- N/A

## Harmful Practices to Stop
- Still starting our work late

## Best/Worst Experience

- Our best experience during sprint two was probably the day the sprint was due. We all got together to help each other out with our pull requests and learnt a lot on how to deal with conflicting code.


- Our worst experience came on the day of the demo, where things appeared to not be working but really it was jusst some minor issues we had with cleaning up the database beforehand to ensure we were starting from scratch.
