## Sprint Goal
The goal of this sprint is to lay the foundation for how our team will work in future sprints and complete user stories SCAR-1, SCAR-2, SCAR-5, SCAR-7 and SCAR-10.

## User Stories Tackled This Sprint
> Create a user account (SCAR-1) <br />
> Create a user profile (SCAR-2) <br />
> Accept player's requests as team captain (SCAR-5) <br />
> Allow user to declare as a free agent (SCAR-7) <br />
> Be able to follow other players (SCAR-10) <br />

## Team Capacity
### Considering this is the first sprint, our team decided to take our time and not overwhelm ourselves with too many tasks. Many of the technologies and languages used for our project are new to many of our team members, and we must account for the learning curve that many of us will have. Considering this we have allocated around 7-11 hours per team member to tackle 5 user stories to complete a total of 40 priority points.
